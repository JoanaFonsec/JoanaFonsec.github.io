Today, my role at Univrses was impacted by layoffs.
It seems that ~15% of the company has been laid-off so far, and my team was eliminated.
It was quite unexpected as I have only worked there for 2 days.

The role was pretty exciting and I was looking forward to work with Computer Vision and Machine Learning for vehicle autonomy, together with this team that I got to meet and which were super kind in my on-boarding, making this news particularly unfortunate.

Now I'm excited about my future and the new learning opportunities that await. If you have any ooportunity you would like to share, please reach out!
