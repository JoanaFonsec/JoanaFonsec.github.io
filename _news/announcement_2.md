With my PhD journey soon coming to an end, it is now time to look for my next project!

***

Within a multitude of options, I remain open to both academia and industry positions.
On the other hand I do have a wish list...

#### Wish List
<ul>
    <li>Exciting project with prospects for novelty and sustainable impact</li>
    <li>Position within Control, Robotics, and/or Learning</li>
    <li>Diverse and strong-willed team</li>
    <li>messenger bag</li>
</ul>
