Today, my role at Univrses was impacted by layoffs.
It is still uncertain but it seems that about 15% of the company has been laid-off so far, and my team was eliminated.
It was quite unexpected as I have only got to work there for 2 days.

The role was pretty exciting and I was looking forward to work with Computer Vision and Machine Learning for vehicle autonomy, together with this team that I got to meet and which were super kind in my on-boarding, making this news particularly unfortunate.

As I transition back to #opentowork Iâ€™m expressing my gratitude to anyone that has opportunities to share.

A bit about me: I like Control, ML, DL, Robotics, Computer Vision, and autonomous driving. I did my PhD in Robotics and ML, resulting in 7+ years of research and 10+ publications. I have a long background of programming in mostly C++ and Python.

Now I'm excited about my future and the new learning opportunities that await!
