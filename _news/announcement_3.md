I just defended my PhD thesis titled Optimizing Ocean Feature Estimation and Tracking Through Adaptive Sampling and Formation Control of AUVs and it went great, with plenty of good discussions!
The defense was on the 28th of September 2023 at KTH, with opponent <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=211078" target="_blank">Prof.Nina Mahmoudian</a> and juri members <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/fidan" target="_blank">Prof. Baris Fidan</a>, <a href="https://taltech.ee/en/contacts/maarja-kruusmaa" target="_blank">Prof. Maarja Kruusmaa</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/janatumova/home" target="_blank">Prof. Jana Tumova</a>.
