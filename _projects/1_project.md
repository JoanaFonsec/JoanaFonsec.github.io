We are a group interested in gender equality at KTH and in the world, and we aim at organizing events and supporting women PhD candidates and postdocs at KTH.

Here follow some of the events we organised.

        KTH employees are invited to a virtual screening of “Picture a Scientist“. This independent documentary follows a groundswell of researchers who are writing a new chapter for science. The screening was followed by a hour-long discussion with Equality Office and WoP.

Stronger Together Mingle 
<br>

WOP, in collaboration with KTH Relocation, hosted a mingle event for women PhD students and postdocs. We guided an open conversation through carefully prepared cards suggesting topics for discussion. Some examples of such cards: "What is the best thing about your work environment?", "What is the worst thing?", "If anyone in this room could help you, what would you ask for?". The objective was to promote deeper conversations and connections among women employees in KTH.

        This event is WOP's most famous and sought-after event. It's a 2-day workshop that takes place at a nature spa hotel, in the Stockholm archipelago - Djurönäset Conference Hotel. The workshop consists of seminars, group discussions, social activities, and is a great opportunity to network and get to know other women PhD students from KTH. Last year’s topic was “Career building: mission, leadership, presence, and relational intelligence” and we had the pleasure of hosting two great speakers: Annelène Decaux and Jennifer Krahn.
