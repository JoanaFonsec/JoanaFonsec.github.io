I did my Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Robotics in KTH supervised by <a href="https://people.kth.se/~kallej/" target="_blank">Professor Karl H. Johansson</a>, in KTH, Sweden.
The topic was optimizing feature estimation and tracking through adaptive sampling and formation control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. I wanted to create a better and autonomous solution to track the algal bloom pollution problem worldwide. We developed control algorithms for single- and multi-agent systems using learning and control tools. The datasets used include satellite and sensor data. 

During my Ph.D., I worked with <a href="https://smarc.se/" target="_blank">SMaRC</a> to implement my algorithms and evaluate its performance in field campaigns in the Baltic Sea, near Stockholm.

I'm also interested in reading and learning about equality, diversity, leadership research, as well as agile methodology and deep-tech innovation.
