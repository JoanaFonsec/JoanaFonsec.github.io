I'm a recently graduated PhD, having worked under the supervision of <a href="https://people.kth.se/~kallej/" target="_blank">Professor Karl H. Johansson</a>, in KTH, Sweden.
My Ph.D. work focused on tracking and forecasting algal blooms using satellite ocean data and USVs. 
I developed control algorithms for multi- and single-agent systems path planning and decision-making based on adaptive sampling, optimization, and modeling 
Currently, I'm implementing my protocol and evaluating its performance to prepare for the experiments in July 2022, through partnership with <a href="https://smarc.se/" target="_blank">SMaRC</a>.

I have also been a part of the network for women Ph.D. candidates, and PostDocs at KTH: <a href="https://www.kth.se/blogs/wop/" target="_blank">WOP</a>. I'm therefore very interested in equality, diversity and leadership research and I would be very happy to continue to read and work on it. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, suggestions, articles, or ideas regarding this field.
